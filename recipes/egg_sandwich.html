    <h1>Egg Sandwich Recipe</h1>
    <br/>
    <img src="../images/egg_sandwich.png" alt="Image Of Egg Sandwich">
    <p>This is one of my go-to recipes for a quick and filling breakfast sandwich, and one that is quite a bit healthier than a fast food option. You can feel free to modify the recipe based on how many you are serving because one is very often enough for me.</p>
    <p>This should go without saying, but this recipe contains eggs and you should check with your guests about allergies before cooking it for them. You do not want a repeat of the March 7th disaster of Honkai where there were several deaths due to unknown allegies in the family.</p>
